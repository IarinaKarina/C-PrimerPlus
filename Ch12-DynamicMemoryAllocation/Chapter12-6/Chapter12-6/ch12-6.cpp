/*6. The Bank of Heather would like to know what would happen if it added a second
ATM. Modify the simulation in this chapter so that it has two queues.Assume that
a customer will join the first queue if it has fewer people in it than the second
queue and that the customer will join the second queue otherwise.Again, find a
value for number of customers per hour that leads to an average wait time of one
minute. (Note:This is a nonlinear problem in that doubling the number of ATMs
doesn’t double the number of customers who can be handled per hour with a oneminute
wait maximum.)
