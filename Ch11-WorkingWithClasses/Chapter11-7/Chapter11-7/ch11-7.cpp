/*7.Define a complex class so that the following program can use it with correct
results:
*/
/*Note that you have to overload the << and >> operators. Standard C++ already has
complex support—rather more extensive than in this example—in a complex
header file, so use complex0.h to avoid conflicts. Use const whenever warranted.
Here is a sample run of the program:
Enter a complex number (q to quit):
real: 10
imaginary: 12
c is (10,12i)
complex conjugate is (10,-12i)
a is (3,4i)
a + c is (13,16i)
a - c is (-7,-8i)
a * c is (-18,76i)
2 * c is (20,24i)
Enter a complex number (q to quit):
real: q
Done!
Note that cin >> c, through overloading, now prompts for real and imaginary
parts.
